Array
Insertion -   It depends....

Removal -   It depends....

Searching -   O(N)

Access -   O(1)

//Object last one was because of think like properties as memory(ram) address in which it does not have to go from 1 to 2 or 2 to 3 then 3 to 4 it directly goes to desired memory location so in returning true or false similarly it does not have to go from 1 to 2. directly it returns whether that memory address exsits or not\
//In array index is key(address) thats why finding value will because O(n)

/*push -   O(1)
pop -   O(1)
shift -   O(N)(shifting n elements after rem from front)
unshift -   O(N)
concat -   O(N)
slice -   O(N)
splice -   O(N)
sort -   O(N * log N)
forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc. -   O(N)*/
